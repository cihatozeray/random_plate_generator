Generating random vehicle license plates are probably a mainstream homework among programming courses

-------

In this example I researched constraints for license plates and I came across www.gib.gov.tr 
(Turkish Republic Tax Administration website) which publishes those constraints valid for different
areas of Turkey

-------

urllib module has been used for web scraping, and mainly Pandas is used for data cleansing

-------

At first try it takes around 22 seconds to execute (also depends on the connection) since it connects
to web, then each plate takes around 0.001 seconds
